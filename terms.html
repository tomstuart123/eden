                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>IUD - Intrauterine device
                </h5>
                <p>
                Eden Cup can be used with an IUD, but we recommend consulting your doctor prior to use

                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>TSS - Toxic Shock Syndrome
                </h5>
                <p>
                    TSS is a rare, but very serious condition. It is a complication of bacterial infections, which has been associated with
                    the use of tampons. However, it is not restricted to women or the use of tampons. In order to get TSS, a person needs to
                    have a specific strain of staph bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) in their body. It is possible to contract TSS when
                    using a cup although it is extremely rare. There have only been a few cases of TSS linked to the use of menstrual cups.
                    To reduce the risk, we recommend only using the cup for maximum 12 hours at the time and take it out to clean it, make
                    sure to wash your hands before inserting and removing the cup.
                    We, Eden Cup, cannot be held liable for any cases of TSS linked to the use of the cup.
                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>Allergic reactions
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The Eden Cup is made from FDA approved, medical-grade silicone, a material that has been tested for biocompatibility and
                    is approved for medical devices and internal use. It’s extremely rare to develop an allergic reaction to medical-grade
                    silicone.
                    However, if one does develop an allergic reaction, Eden Cup cannot be held responsible, and do not offer any kind of
                    compensation in such a case.

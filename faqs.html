                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>What size is right for me?</h5>
                <p>
                    As a rule of thumb, the size depends on your age, and whether or not you’ve given birth naturally. If you are under 30
                    we recommend the small size, similarly if you haven't given birth. If you are over 30 or have given birth naturally, we
                    would recommend trying a ‘large’ size.
                    
                    Ultimately, there is a little trial and error with this one. As your cervix moves throughout your cycle, some women find
                    that a combination of sizes works best, depending on the stage of the period.

                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>How do I take my Eden Cup out?</h5>
                <p>To remove your Eden cup, pinch the cup at its base to break the seal. You will then be able to gently pull the cup out
                of the vaginal opening. Take care to tilt the cup towards you so that the blood remains within the cup.
                
                Once removed, simply pour the contents into the toilet or down the sink, rinse or wipe the cup, and reinsert.

                </p>

                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>How do I empty my Eden Cup in public?</h5>
                <p>Changing the cup in public facilities couldn’t be easier. Simply remove the cup, pour the contents away, wipe with paper
                and reinsert. If you would prefer to rinse the cup before reinsertion, you could take a bottle of water into the cubicle
                with you.
                
                There are no wrappers to dispose of or tricky parts to juggle so changing your menstrual cup is often easier, and more
                discreet, than a traditional tampon or pad.

                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>What should it feel like?</h5>
                <p>Ideally, you should not be able to feel your Eden cup when worn correctly. Many women do take one or two cycles to get
                used to the cup sitting lower in the vaginal canal and therefore not having to insert it so far.
                
                If you find that the stem is too exposed, you can trim it with a pair of scissors. The stem is solid silicone and
                therefore your cup won’t leak if it is trimmed.

                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>Can I urinate whilst wearing my Eden cup?</h5>
                <p>Yes. Urination will not affect your Eden Cup in any way.
                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>What if I have allergies?</h5>
                <p>The Eden Cup is made from 100% medical grade silicon, therefore please do not use it if you have a silicon allergy.
                
                Additionally, there is a small chance that the cotton fibres from your Eden bag may rub off onto the cup, so make sure
                to fully sterilise the cup before and after your cycle, and be mindful if you have cotton allergies.

                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>How long will my Eden cup last?
                </h5>
                <p>Your Eden cup can last up to 10 years, as long as the Eden cup is properly sterilised in boiling water before and after
                each cycle.

                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>IUD - Intrauterine device
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Eden Cup can be used with an IUD, but we recommend consulting your doctor prior to use
                    Eden Cup cannot be held responsible for any kind of IUD errors or failings, including it being
                    dislodged, and do not
                    offer any kind of compensation in such case.

                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>How often should I change my Eden cup?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    We recommend that you change your Eden cup at least every 10 hours.
                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>Can I use my Eden cup with an IUD?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Yes, you can use your Eden Cup with a IUD. Your Eden Cup should never impact the IUD in any way. It is important to
                    release your Eden cup’s seal before removal, however we must stress if you feel and pain when removing the cup, stop and
                    change either your position or removal method, and consult with a doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.

                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>How do I store my Eden cup?
                <p>
                    After your cycle is finished, we recommend that you sterilise your Eden cup, dry it thoroughly and keep it in its cotton
                    bag until your next cycle.
                    
                    Please do not store your Eden cup in a sealed container, or while wet and it can cause harmful bacteria to grow.
                    
                    We always recommend sterilising your cup again before your next use.
                
                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>Can I play sport and exercise with my Eden Cup?
                </h5>
                <p>
                The Eden Cup is perfect for use while exercising, even with sports such as swimming or upside-down yoga poses! Your Eden
                cup holds more than a traditional tampon and so you can exercise for longer without worry, even up to 10 hours.
                
                We would recommend emptying your cup before and after sport to ensure cleanliness.

                
                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>Can I travel with my Eden Cup?
                </h5>
                <p>
                The Eden Cup is small, light and durable and therefore perfect for use when travelling - no more having to carry or
                source boxes of tampons or pads for fear of being caught short. When using your Eden Cup abroad, make sure to use the
                same standard of water that you would drink to rinse or sterlise your cup in order to ensure cleanliness.
                
                Use your hand Eden bag to store your cup when travelling to ensure that it does not get dirty or covered in particles
                from your bag.

                
                </p>
                <h5 class='benefitSection__subheaderThree'>-Can I wear my Eden Cup throughout my period?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Yes. Your Eden cup can be worn on both light and heavy days, and its non-absorbent nature ensures you wont suffer from
                    dryness.
                    
                    Some users have also noted reduced menstrual cramps.
